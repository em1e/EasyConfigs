## ⚔️ Java vs Bedrock

There are two main editions of Minecraft you’ll come across in development:

| Feature         | Java Edition                       | Bedrock Edition                              |
|-----------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Platform        | PC                                 | PC, consoles, mobile                          |
| Modding support | High (Forge, Fabric, Spigot, etc.) | Limited, uses different APIs (like Add-Ons)  |
| Language        | Java                               | JSON + scripting in JavaScript/Block coding  |
| Community tools | Vast & open-source                 | Mostly proprietary or marketplace-based      |

> 🧠 For development and server-side customization, **Java Edition** is the most flexible and widely supported.

## 🧩 Plugins vs Mods

Understanding the difference is key to choosing your dev path:

|                     | Plugins                              | Mods                                       |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Runs on             | Server only (e.g., Spigot, Paper)     | Both client and server (e.g., Forge)       |
| Requires client mod | ❌ No                                 | ✅ Yes (users must install mod too)         |
| Programming language| Java                                  | Java                                       |
| Use case            | Add server features, commands, APIs   | Add new blocks, mechanics, GUIs, etc.      |

> If you're running a Minecraft **server**, plugins are usually easier and safer to maintain, especially for multiplayer.
