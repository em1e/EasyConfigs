# ‚öôÔ∏è How to Set Up a Local Development Server

Running a local test server is essential when developing plugins or mods‚Äîyou should never test gameplay-changing code on a production server!

---

## Why You Need a Local Dev Server

- **Test safely**, without affecting live players.
- **Crash-proof features** while experimenting.
- **Faster iteration**‚Äîno remote uploads or latency.

You can think of it as your personal Minecraft development sandbox.

---

## üß© Prerequisites

- Java 17 or 21 (depending on your server version)
- A server jar (PaperMC is recommended)
- Plugins or mods you‚Äôre working on
- A terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell on Windows, Terminal on macOS)

---

## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Setup

---

### **Step 1: Install Java**

#### Windows
1. Download and install OpenJDK from [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net).
2. During installation, check **‚ÄúAdd to PATH‚Äù** and **‚ÄúSet JAVA_HOME‚Äù**.

#### macOS
```bash
brew install openjdk@21
```

Then add to your ~/.zshrc:

```bash
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@21/bin:$PATH"
```

---

### **Step 2: Download the Server Jar**
1. Choose PaperMC from papermc.io/downloads.
2. Download the latest version matching your Minecraft server.
3. Rename the jar to paper.jar and move it into a clean folder (e.g., ~/Minecraft/dev-server).

---

### **Step 3: Create the Launch Script** 
#### Windows (start.bat):
```bash
java -Xms1G -Xmx2G -jar paper.jar nogui
pause
```

#### macOS / Linux (start.sh):
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
java -Xms1G -Xmx2G -jar paper.jar nogui
```

Then:
```bash
chmod +x start.sh
```
Adjust -Xms/-Xmx based on available RAM.

---

### **Step 4: Accept the EULA**
1. Run the script once.
2. Open the generated eula.txt and change:
`eula=false` to `eula=true`

---

### **Step 5: Add Your Plugin(s)**
1. In the server directory, ensure there's a plugins/ folder.
2. Add your plugin .jar file(s) or development build.

---

### **Step 6: Launch the Server**
1. Run the script again:
- On Windows: double-click start.bat.
- On macOS/Linux: ./start.sh.

The console window will show plugin load logs‚Äîif any crash, you‚Äôll see stack traces here.

---

### **Step 7: Connect and Test**
1. Launch Minecraft (matching the server version).
2. Add `localhost` in your Multiplayer servers list.
3. Join and start testing your plugin features.
