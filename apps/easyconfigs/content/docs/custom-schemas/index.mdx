import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout'

YAMLCraft supports custom schemas to help validate and autocomplete your YAML files based on your specific use case.

This is useful for:

- Configuring CI/CD pipelines
- Defining game object structures
- Creating repeatable infrastructure configs for purposes

---

## Step 1: Define Your Schema

Create a `.json` or `.yaml` schema file that matches your expected structure:

### âœ… Example: `my-schema.json`

```yaml
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "title": "Game Object",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "name": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Name of the object"
    },
    "type": {
      "type": "string",
      "enum": ["npc", "item", "environment"]
    },
    "position": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": { "type": "number" },
      "minItems": 3,
      "maxItems": 3
    }
  },
  "required": ["name", "type", "position"]
}
```

---

## Step 2: Create a new schema on YAMLcraft
Find Generators > Custom Schemas > Create new to start creating a new schema. Ontop of loading the file there are a handful of settings you can choose from:
- Name, Minecraft Edition, and Version
- Is it a Mod or Plugin
- Is it Public or Private
- Does it output Yaml or Json files

Useful resources:
- ðŸ“˜ [How to version schemas?](https://semver.org/)
- ðŸ“˜ [How to create or find a schema?](/docs/custom-schemas/troubleshooting)
- ðŸ“˜ [New to minecraft development?](/docs/mc-dev-101/introduction)

ðŸ’¡ _This schema can now be used to create YAML files in the future too._

---

## Next: Creating files using the custom schema
Your custom schemas should automatically get added into your schema library, meaning if you create a new file using generator > new file it should give it to you as an option.

ðŸ’¡ _If you for some reason do not see it there, then double check the schema, ask for help on our discord server or contant support._
