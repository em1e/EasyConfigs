##June 2025 - The Start

June 16th is when it all started, a small idea that turned into a project that will be worked on for years to come.
It went as follows:

```yaml
"I hope there was a website where anyone would click a few buttons to easily write these damn configs.
I'm sick of how long these take :C " - Mie

"I know right! I've been tracking with our bedrock pack for the past two weeks. 
Maybe there's a script that could do this for me?" - Ryan

"Pretty sure that'd be something widely known if there was haha" - Mie
```

Which spoiler, after looking into it there wasn't anytghing easy to use, just some shell scripts that had one purpose or nothing at all.
