## Step 1: Choose a Plugin or Config Type

Select the Minecraft plugin or mod you'd like to generate a configuration file for.  
Popular options include [MythicMobs](https://mythiccraft.io/index.php?pages/official-mythicmobs-download/), [LuckPerms](https://luckperms.net/), [Citizens](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/citizens.13811/) and [Quests](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/quests-1-8-1-21-set-up-goals-for-players.23696/). 

However, you are also able to download your own schema files to customize how the generator will generate the files for you. Read more about this process [here]()!

_This helps load the correct schema and interface for that config type, since each plugin does configuration differently._

---

## Step 2: Fill in Config Fields via GUI

Use the user-friendly interface to fill out key settings:
- Toggle options
- Input values (numbers, strings, lists)
- Add nested elements dynamically

Suggestions are included in the most common plugins.

_Fields are validated as you go, preventing common YAML syntax errors._

---

## Step 3: Preview YAML Output

Switch to the **Preview** tab to instantly view the auto-generated YAML file as you go.  
The editor offers:
- Syntax highlighting  
- Error checking  
- Live updates as you change input values

---

## Step 4: Export or Copy the Config

Once you're happy with the result, you can either:
- **Download** the `.yml` file
- **Copy to clipboard**
- **Save the project into your account**

_You can also export a version with inline comments for easier collaboration._

---

## Step 5: Use it in Your Minecraft Server

Move the config file into the appropriate plugin folder (e.g. `/plugins/plugin/`)  
Restart or reload the plugin using your server console.

---

ðŸ”¥ Thatâ€™s it! Youâ€™ve created a valid config without writing a single line of YAML by hand.
