title: About Us
description: YAMLcraft is a user-friendly GUI tool that helps you build clean, accurate Minecraft YAML config files. No syntax errors. No formatting issues. Just the configs you need.
---

**We don't just offer a generator. It’s how you build your server configs visually.**

Most Minecraft plugin configurations require manual editing of YAML files. Whether you're setting up custom mobs, regions, shops, or permissions, you're forced to write raw YAML — one indentation error away from breaking everything.

This is what **YAMLcraft** solves. It’s designed around the following principles:

- **Visual Simplicity:** Use clean form inputs instead of writing YAML by hand.
- **Schema-Based Logic:** Each supported plugin has a dynamic schema that defines what can be configured.
- **Export-Ready:** One click to copy or download valid YAML files.
- **Extensibility:** Add your own templates, or contribute plugin support.
- **Error-Free Output:** Built-in validation removes formatting mistakes entirely.

## Visual Simplicity

YAMLcraft replaces hand-written YAML with a structured interface. You select options, toggle values, and type only what’s needed.

- **No Syntax Errors:** Every config is structured and validated behind the scenes.
- **Faster Configuration:** Spend more time designing gameplay, not formatting files.
- **Live Preview:** See the generated YAML as you build.

_You no longer need to guess where an indent goes or wonder if a boolean was typed correctly._

## Schema-Based Logic

Each plugin in YAMLcraft is backed by a config schema that defines:

- Available settings  
- Default values  
- Allowed data types  
- Dependencies between fields

This enables intelligent auto-complete, conditional fields, and plugin-specific validation — all without custom coding.

## Export-Ready

Once your configuration is ready:

- Download it as a `.yml` file  
- Copy to clipboard  
- Or sync it directly to your project folder *(coming soon)*

Your config is ready to plug and play.

## Extensibility

YAMLcraft was created as a side project by em1e. 
You can contact the developer through EXAMPLE@gmail.com to:

- Add new plugin to be supported, this requires a schema in a JSON or YAML file 
- Reach out for possibly becoming a maintainer. If you do, please add "Maintainer: " in the beginning of the subject

_We at YAMLcraft aim to evolve with Minecraft’s plugin ecosystem. Though newest updates might not be supposted right away._

## Error-Free Output

No more indentation nightmares or mysterious startup errors.

YAMLcraft aims to:

- Follows strict YAML rules  
- Provide inline validation  
- Support version-specific plugin quirks

**You build configs. We handle the structure.**
